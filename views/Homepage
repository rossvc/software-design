    <p>
      Welcome to Together for Texas! We are a non-profit organization that
      provides resources to those in need in Texas. We are dedicated to helping
      those who have been affected by natural disasters, such as hurricanes,
      floods, and wildfires. Our mission is to provide support to those who need
      it most, and to help rebuild communities that have been devastated by
      these disasters.
